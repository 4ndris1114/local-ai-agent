Unexpected delight,2024-03-22,5,"Stumbled upon this place by accident and was blown away. The truffle mushroom pizza was out of this world. Rich flavors, crispy crust, and friendly service made this a new favorite."
Slow service,2024-02-14,2,"Food was decent, but we waited 45 minutes just to get seated even though we had a reservation. Once the pizza arrived, it was lukewarm and underwhelming. Not worth the hassle."
Not worth the hype,2024-01-28,3,"Everyone raved about this place, but I found it average. The crust was too thin and floppy, and the sauce lacked depth. It wasn't bad, just not memorable."
Kid-friendly and cozy,2024-03-11,5,"They had coloring sheets for kids, and the staff were super accommodating. The pizza was delicious and came out quickly. Ideal for a casual family night out."
Too many burnt bubbles,2024-02-01,2,"The crust was filled with large burnt air pockets, making some slices practically inedible. I appreciate a charred finish, but this was overdone. Wouldn’t return."
Creative combos,2024-01-17,4,"Their kimchi and pork belly pizza sounded odd but totally worked. I love that they experiment with flavors without it feeling forced. Still thinking about it days later!"
Lovely atmosphere,2024-03-05,5,"Candles on the tables, soft music, and great lighting made for the perfect date night. The four-cheese pizza melted perfectly and paired great with a glass of red wine."
Bland and boring,2024-02-19,2,"I ordered the vegetarian pizza and it tasted like cardboard. No seasoning, watery toppings, and barely any cheese. Ended up adding my own spices at home."
Great for takeout,2024-01-22,4,"I usually get delivery from here. Always fast and the pizza is piping hot. Their garlic knots are amazing too – don’t skip them!"
Missed the mark,2024-03-16,3,"The buffalo chicken pizza sounded promising but was way too heavy on sauce and the chicken was dry. Had potential, but not executed well."
